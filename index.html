      <h2>What is Hot Wheels?</h2>
      <p>
        Hot Wheels is a popular brand of die-cast toy cars introduced by Mattel in 1968. Known for their vibrant designs, fast-rolling wheels, and detailed miniatures, Hot Wheels quickly became a favorite among kids and collectors worldwide. What makes Hot Wheels "hot" is not just their sleek, creative car models, but also their connection to real-life car culture, limited editions, and exciting tracks that bring high-speed fun to life. Over the decades, they’ve evolved into a cultural icon, blending play, design, and nostalgia.

        I started collecting Hot Wheels when I was just six years old. Back then, it wasn’t just about the cars — it was about the dream. I used to imagine that one day, I’d grow up and drive a real car like the ones I saw in miniature. Each model felt like a step toward that future.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every time we went to the supermarket, I begged my mom to buy me one Hot Wheels car. Sometimes she said yes, sometimes no — but slowly, the collection grew. I was proud of what I had, especially when I could show my friends a rare model they hadn’t seen before. It felt like I had something special, something that set me apart.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, years later, that collection has grown to 90 cars. Each one holds a memory. Some came easily, some took a lot of searching, but they all remind me of the kid who dreamed big. I’m still chasing that dream — not just with toy cars, but with real goals. I know Hot Wheels are just toys, but the passion behind collecting them taught me patience, persistence, and how to value what I love.

      <p>
        Today, I’m still working on completing the full set. At the same time, I’m focused on building a smart career and saving money. I’ve started selling a few rare models on eBay — not to give up the hobby, but to turn it into something bigger. One day, I’ll use what I’ve saved to buy my real dream car. The one I used to picture when I was six years old, holding a tiny version of it in my hands.
